# Pre-Work-Study Guide

## Description
• This is my inital pre-work that was completed prior and during the first week of class.  I set out to complete this miniture project to ensure that I had an understanding of the base foundations needed to begin class work without falling behind or missunderstanding the work.  This pre-work study guide and its creation serves as a foundational beginning of my studies towards becooming a web developer. I have often wondered if I would excell in this line of work or if I would benifit from a career change from QA testing to development.  Given my past working within the gaming industry I knew that it wouldn't be too difficult of a change for me to make.  However, given how long it has been since I physically programmed, other than some basic JSON, Javascript and python work, I knew that I would need some guidence on how to perform and current industry standards.  Most of the game development I was apart of occured within a visual scripting system called Blueprints located in the unreal platform.  This has caused a lack of practice to create a divide in my skills.  I also focused on a lot of art work and knew that I would benifit from moving back to developement.  Within this small project I have already learned a great amount.  It encompassed a variety of problems to solve includinng: HTML, css, Javascript, asset creation and general git and gitbash practices.  It has also brushed up my usage of the console which has been fantastic.  I am thankful for this inital project and cannot wait to use the skills I have learned within it going forward.

## Installation
• There are no installation steps required.  The project is housed within a GitHub repository that has an index.html file within it.  All assets and files are included within the folders and sub-folders located on the repo.  If one wanted to pull the repo to examine the project in detail then cloning the repository would be the only step required.  Otherwise the link is live and can be accessed here on GitHub

## Usage
• Usage of the website is very simple.  Opening the link will prove that it is only a single page that has information located on the main landing page.
There is a list of information and notes that I have created for my own usage and reflection as I learn more within the class.  Notes will periodically be added for future use as I learn more.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## Credits
• All credit for the materials, files and coding examples are giving to the bootcamp instructors and the information provided within the pre-work course material.  
Information and details can be found here: https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5300/modules
No other materials, assets, or coding example were used from other sources.

## License
• This project has a standard MIT license.  Source: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/


## Badges
• N/A at this time.

## Features 
(subject to future improvment and change).
• index.html file that houses the code for the project and links together all assets used within it.
• css file used to dictate the style of the webpage.
• JavaScripting that can be viewed within the developer view of chrome.  Access the console to see the results and the script.js file to view setup and usage.

## Contributions
• Contribuation is welcome and accepted.  Without changing the overall layout, unless specified to myself the creator, feel free to edit, update, fix or add notes and material that would prove benifical to my learning experience.
• Should the information prove to become to large to house on a single page then I will eventually learn to update the webpage to house additional sections and pages to switch between subjects to allow for better ease of use when studying the material for future classword.

## Tests
• Testing has not been included within this project as of yet.  I look forward to learning more about this process, given my QA experience, and adding it to the project in the future.
